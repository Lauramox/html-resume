<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Laura. Thanks for visiting my page! I am a senior graphic designer with 18yrs experience in the print industry. Recently I have received my certification as a web developer. 
  I enjoy working on websites because I enjoy seeing the changes happen instantly. I also like to be challenged in my thinking. My goal is to work for myself, to create websites for small business who desperatly need online exposure.</p>

<p>The very first website I ever created was for my former church, Experience Life Church. 
  The pastoral team had great faith in my abilities to build and maintain their website.
I've created dozens of pages, entry forms, links to internal and external pages including anchors, and I've added imagery and videos as well.  </p>

<p>In my spare time I enjoy dancing, yoga, walking, gardening, cooking, creating essential oils and spendig time with my kids.
